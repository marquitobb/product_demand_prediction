# Challenge 2


## Product Demand Prediction

A product company plans to offer discounts on its product during the upcoming holiday season. The company wants to find the price at which its product can be a better deal compared to its competitors. For this task, the company provided a dataset of past changes in sales based on price changes. You need to train a model that can predict the demand for the product in the market with different price segments.

The dataset that we have for this task contains data about:

1. the product id.
2. store id.
3. total price at which product was sold.
4. base price at which product was sold.
5. Units sold (quantity demanded).

Feature 1: Train the model to predict the product demand.
Feature 2: Enter values (Total Price, Base Price) into the model and predict how much quantity can be demanded based on those values
